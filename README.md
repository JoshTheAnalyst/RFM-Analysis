This project presents an RFM analysis for GreenMart, a supermarket with both online and physical stores. 
The analysis categorizes customers based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary metrics to better understand purchasing behaviors and customer value. Using this method, customers are segmented into groups such as loyal customers, big spenders, and at-risk customers. These insights help GreenMart optimize marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and drive revenue growth by focusing on high-value customers and re-engaging inactive ones. The analysis was conducted using advanced Excel techniques, ensuring comprehensive customer segmentation for data-driven decision-making.
